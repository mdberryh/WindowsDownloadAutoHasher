# WindowsDownloadAutoHasher
A C# program that will run in the background waiting for a file to be written in the Downloads directory. This will trigger a prompt, which will request a hash to verify the file.

For now it is just an example of Filewatching and hashing. Eventually I would like to add a configuration page for the user to edit the directory that is being watched and add more directories.
